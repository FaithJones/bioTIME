Here are the R files where I manipulate and prepare the biotime ABUNDANCE data for analysis. 

Order of running files:

1. Remove years with too few samples.
    removingSamllValuesAbundance.r
    This is code to remove years were less than half the average sample size was collected.
    This is important to ensure the rarefaction does not rarefy years to too few samples

2. Rarefy data 1000 times. 
    rarefyingcodeAbundance.r
    This is for when you want the data rarefied so yuo can run analisys on community level 
    data like assemblage size or species richness. You loose individual species abundance
    and identity. This data is based on maria Dorneles' rarefying code used in the 2014 
    science paper.
    
 OR
    
2. Rerefy data once. 
    Rarefy_Abundance_once.r
    This rarefies the data only once. This is lessreliabel than 1000 times, but dies keep
    indicidual species abundance and identity. This is the rarefied data that is used in 
    subsequent analysis of dominance and evenness.
