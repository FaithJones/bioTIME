This analysis has been undertaken with Anne Magurran (St Andrews) and Shane Blowes (iDiv).

The analysis aims to compare change in sepcies richness within assemblages to change in evenness. 
The bioTime database was used for this analysis
For every dataset sample based rarefation was used to account for ampling effort differences. 
  In order to retain individual species identites I only rarefied once, instead of rarefying many 
  times and taking a mean

The draft paper is contained in "Evenness analysis_v2"

data is not generally incuded in this repository as data files can be very large.
