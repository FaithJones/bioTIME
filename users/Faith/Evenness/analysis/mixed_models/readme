Here are the three mixed models I ran:
  1. Pielou's Evenness (Abundance_Calcluate_Evenness)
  2. Pie (Abundance_Calcluate_Evenness_Sim)
  3. Species Richness (AdundanceAnalysisMixedModel_TAXA_SR)
  
  mean centred year was used in every case as a fixed effect, and Log2 was used for species richness.
  Assemblage was incuded as a random effect with differeing slopes and intercepts
