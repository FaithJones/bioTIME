Here I used the extracted slopes of change in species richness and evenness for each assemblage. 
These slopes are extracted from the mixed models. 
I compare by plotting both data and running Spearmans Rank corrilation tests
I also split data into smaller chunks - taxa and big/small assemblage

Data:
1. evennessChangeSimpAb - slopes of change of PIE evenness
2. evennessChange - slopes of change of Pielous evenness
3. SpeciesRichnessChange - slopes of change of species richness
