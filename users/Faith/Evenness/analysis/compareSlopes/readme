Here I used the extracted slopes of change in species richness and evenness for each assemblage. 
These slopes are extracted from the mixed models. 
I compare by plotting both data and running Spearmans Rank corrilation tests
I also split data into smaller chunks - taxa and big/small assemblage

Data:
1. evennessChangeSimpAb - slopes of change of PIE evenness
2. evennessChange - slopes of change of Pielous evenness
3. SpeciesRichnessChange - slopes of change of species richness 

Analysis Code
1. CompareResults_ellipse.r - this code contains most of the different
   ways i tried anlyising the two slopes of change. This incudes early cluster 
   analyses, corrilation tests and plots
2. SrEvennessChange_bigSmall.r - code seperating data into assemblages of few 
   species (>20) and may species (<20), to see if teh corrilation is different
   for small assemblages. Also included are plots of these two groups
3. Evemmes_SR_AssemblageSizePIE.rmd - R markdown file containing plots of evenness 
   change (PIE) against both species richness and assemblage size
